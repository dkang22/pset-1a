    	<h3>The Best Banana Bread Recipe</h3>

<p>There’s no such thing as over-ripe bananas when it comes to banana bread!</p>
<p>Difficulty: Easy</p>

	<p>Ingredients: </p>

<ul>
	<li>1 cup of granulated sugar</li>
  <li>1 stick (8 tbsp) of unsalted, room temperature butter</li>
  <li>2 eggs at room temperature</li>
  <li>4 ripe bananas</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon of milk</li>
  <li>1.5 teaspoons of ground cinnamon</li>
  <li>2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
  <li>6 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>Preheat the oven to 325 Fahrenheit. Spray a 9x5x3 in. glass loaf pan with butter and line it with parchment paper</li>
	<li>Using an electric mixer (or by hand), cream the sugar and butter until it becomes a homogenous mixture. Beat the eggs into the sugar and butter mixture one at a time.</li>
	<li>In a bowl, mash the bananas with a fork. It is ok if there are some small chunks of banana. Mix in the cinnamon and milk</li>
	<li>In another bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.</li>
	<li>Add the banana mixture to the creamed butter mixture. Make sure it is well combined.</li>
	<li>Slowly pour the dry ingredients (flour mixture) into the banana/butter mixture. Mix until the white flour isn’t visible in the batter.</li>
	<li>Fold the chocolate chips into the batter until evenly dispersed.</li>
	<li>Pour the batter into the parchment-paper-lined pan. Bake for 70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the bread comes out without wet batter.</li>
	<li>Allow the fully baked loaf to cool for 20 minutes before removing it from the pan.</li>
	<li>Slice the loaf and enjoy it with a glass of milk!</li>
