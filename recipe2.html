    	<h3>Smooth Dark Chocolate Mousse</h3>

      <p>This is a perfect dessert to whip up if you love chocolate!</p>
      <p>Difficulty: Medium</p>

	    <p>Ingredients: </p>

        <ul>
	         <li>3 tablespoons of unsalted butter</li>
           <li>6 ounces of the best quality semi-sweet chocolate</li>
           <li>3 large eggs</li>
           <li>4 ripe bananas</li>
           <li>0.5 teaspoon of cream of tartar</li>
           <li>0.25 cup plus 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar</li>
           <li>0.5 cup of cold heavy cream</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

      <ol>
	       <li>Put the butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Place the bowl on a double-boiler. Stir with a spatula until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is completely smooth.</li>
	       <li>Allow the melted chocolate/butter mixture to cool for a few minutes. In the meantime, separate the 3 eggs’ whites and yolks into separate bowls.</li>
	       <li>Once the few minutes have passed, whisk in the egg yolks one at a time until fully incorporated into the chocolate mixture.</li>
	       <li>Using an electric hand mixture, beat the egg whites on medium speed until foamy. Add in the cream of tartar and beat on medium-high speed until soft peaks form. Begin to incorporate 0.25 cup of sugar until stiff peaks form (the egg whites should maintain a stiff point when the mixer is lifted from the bowl).</li>
	       <li>Using a spatula, fold the egg white mixture into the chocolate mixture. Set aside.</li>
	       <li>In a separate bowl, beat the heavy cream on medium-high speed with an electric mixer until the cream thickens. Add in the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar and the vanilla. Continue beating until medium peaks <strong>(do not over mix)</strong>.</li>
	       <li>Fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture. Be sure to fully combine the two mixtures together, but <strong>do not over fold</strong> because it will remove air from the mousse.</li>
	       <li>Scoop the mousse mixture into 6 individual glasses. Cover the glasses and chill them in the refrigerator for at least two hours.</li>
	       <li>Once fully chilled, enjoy the mousse!</li>
